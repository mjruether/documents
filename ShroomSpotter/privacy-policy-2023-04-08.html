    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how [Your App Name] ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects the information of users ("you", "your", "user") of the [Your App Name] mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. We recommend that you periodically review this policy for any changes. Your continued use of the App after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to allow users to log mushroom finds and their location without collecting any personal information about the user. We do not collect or store any personal information, such as your name, email address, or profile picture.</p>

    <p>Mushroom Finds: When you log a mushroom find and have opted into online backup, we collect information about the mushroom, including its type, appearance, location, and any additional notes you provide. We also collect the date and time of the find. If you have not opted into online backup, you're information will be stored on your device only.'</p>

    <p>Location Information: When you use the App, we may collect and store information about your location, including GPS coordinates, by converting your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address into a rough geolocation.</p>

    <p>Device Information: We may collect information about your device, such as the device model, operating system, unique device identifier, and mobile network information.</p>

    <p>Usage Information: We collect information about how you use the App, including the features you interact with and the frequency and duration of your use.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features.</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience, such as by displaying mushroom finds relevant to your location.</li>
        <li>To monitor and analyze usage trends and preferences.</li>
        <li>To detect, prevent, or address technical issues, security threats, or fraudulent activity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>With your consent: We may share your information with third parties when you explicitly consent to such sharing.</li>
        <li>For legal reasons: We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to legal process, such as a subpoena, court order, or government request.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share any personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes since we do not collect personal information.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the App's services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>
